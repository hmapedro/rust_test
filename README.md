# Rust project repository template

This repository template provides a pre-configured (and probably opiniated) Rust project template that enforces the Rust coding's best practices and guidelines the Sofair ecosystem would like to enforce in its project repositories. Of course, if you want to modify or refine some of the tools or configurations that are offered, you can do so.

## How to use this project template

In order to use this Rust project template, here are the steps to follow:

- **Create your repo**: start by [creating a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) from this template for your project, giving the latter a new name.

- **Set your project's title**: replace the title of this REAMDE.md file, with the name of your new project.

- **Set your Git username and email**: so that to put a name on a contribution and be able to contact the author, please [set your Git username and email](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git).

## How can I contribute to this project

Open source software is neither contagious nor a [cancer](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-no-we-dont-hate-open-source-software-and-we-can-prove-it/), as some narrow-minded people have said in the past!

We therefore encourage you to jump on the free software bandwagon and help us, through your contributions and your passion (which we hope will be as contagious as possible), to build this audacious project with our community.

"How can I contribute to this project", you may ask? First, we invite you to read carefully our [Contributor's Bible](./CONTRIBUTOR_BIBLE.md).

The second question you are probably asking yourself is "how can I be of help to this project"? Here are a few suggestions that come to mind:

- Sharing knowledge and know-how is crucial in such community-driven project. So why not helping us writing the documentation? This will give you a good understanding of the concepts and technology behind Sofair.

- If you're a passionate software engineer, why not contributing through coding? Some challenging tasks in cryptography, graph-based database, blockchain, networking, maths and more can challenge your neurons. Be sure that the core projec's team will always take care of onboarding newcommers with care, so that they feel comfortable contributing with us.

- And more...

The next concrete step is to take the plunge by picking one the outstanding tasks on the project's management board. For doing so, please bump to the [Getting started](./CONTRIBUTOR_BIBLE.md) paragraph of our `Contributor's Bible`.

If none of the above resonates with you, do not hesitate to send us an email at `community@sofair.io`. You are sure to meet an open tribe eager to accept new ideas or contributions. Don't be shy!
